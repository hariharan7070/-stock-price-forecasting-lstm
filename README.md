# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM

This project uses historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and applies an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model to forecast future stock prices.

---
 Features
- Fetches historical stock prices (AAPL) using `yfinance`
- Normalizes data using MinMaxScaler
- Builds and trains an LSTM neural network with Keras
- Predicts future stock prices
- Visualizes actual vs predicted prices
- Evaluates model using RMSE

---
 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- yfinance
- numpy, pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow / keras
